    "opinion": "Inertia is one of the technologies that blew my mind. When I first started using Laravel, I mainly use it to build APIs that my frontend applications consume. It's quite a pain-in-the ass to maintain two separate repos. But with Inertia, it's very easy to build powerful full-stack apps."
