This post is a continuation and basically an application based on my previous post, <a href={devEnvironmentPost.frontmatter.slug}>{devEnvironmentPost.frontmatter.title}</a>, in which we are going to run a Laravel application with Inertia and Vue.js frontend using our previous setup, which is Docker.

## Requirements

### PHP CLI (at least version 8.2)

In modern debian-based distros, you can just install it using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt install -y php-cli
```

<Alert severity="warn">
    Note that we are just installing the CLI version of PHP, not the standalone
    `php` package from APT, since it also ships `apache` by default, and we
    don't want `apache` to take over our port 80 once it gets installed on our
    system. So we should just install the CLI version.
</Alert>

### Composer

We also need Composer CLI on our system to easily generate Laravel projects with a single command.

#### PHP Extensions

Even if we're gonna run Laravel through Docker, we still need the PHP extensions needed by Laravel for us to generate a project.

To install Composer, just enter these commands on your terminal:

```bash
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

Alright! Let's generate our Laravel project!

## Generate Laravel project

To easily create a Laravel project, let's first install the Laravel installer globally:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Then, let's check if we have the `laravel` command on our terminal:

```diff lang="bash"
laravel

- zsh: command not found: laravel
```

Oops! ZSH doesn't consider our global Laravel installation. Let's fix it by including the Composer bin to our `PATH` variable on our `.zshrc`:

Open our `.zshrc` file on our editor:

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```diff lang="bash" title="~/.zshrc"

# .. other lines

+ # Composer
+ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin
```

Then, let's source the file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

That's it! The `laravel` command should now work.

```bash
laravel

Laravel Installer 5.7.2

Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

Options:
  -h, --help            Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
  -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
  -V, --version         Display this application version
      --ansi|--no-ansi  Force (or disable --no-ansi) ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Available commands:
  completion  Dump the shell completion script
  help        Display help for a command
  list        List commands
  new         Create a new Laravel application
```

Nice! Now let's generate our project. First, let's create a project directory if you don't have one:

```bash title="~"
mkdir projects
```
