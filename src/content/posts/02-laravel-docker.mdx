This post is a continuation and basically an application based on my previous post, <a href={`/blog/${devEnvironmentPost.frontmatter.slug}`}>{devEnvironmentPost.frontmatter.title}</a>, in which we are going to run a Laravel application with Inertia and Vue.js frontend using our previous setup, which is Docker.

## Requirements

### PHP CLI (at least version 8.2)

In modern debian-based distros, you can just install it using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt install -y php-cli
```

<Alert severity="warn">
    Note that we are just installing the CLI version of PHP, not the standalone
    `php` package from APT, since it also ships `apache` by default, and we
    don't want `apache` to take over our port 80 once it gets installed on our
    system. So we should just install the CLI version.
</Alert>

#### PHP Extensions

Even if we're gonna run Laravel through Docker, we still need the PHP extensions needed by Laravel for us to generate a project.

To install required PHP extensions by Laravel, just use this command:

```bash
sudo apt install openssl php-bcmath php-curl php-json php-mbstring php-mysql php-tokenizer php-xml php-zip
```

### Composer

We also need Composer CLI on our system to easily generate Laravel projects with a single command.

To install Composer, just enter these commands on your terminal:

```bash
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

Alright! Let's generate our Laravel project!

## Generate Laravel project

To easily create a Laravel project, let's first install the Laravel installer globally:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Then, let's check if we have the `laravel` command on our terminal:

```diff lang="bash"
laravel

- zsh: command not found: laravel
```

Oops! ZSH doesn't consider our global Laravel installation. Let's fix it by including the Composer bin to our `PATH` variable on our `.zshrc`:

Open our `.zshrc` file on our editor:

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```diff lang="bash" title="~/.zshrc"

# .. other lines

+ # Composer
+ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin
```

Then, let's source the file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

That's it! The `laravel` command should now work.

```bash
laravel

Laravel Installer 5.7.2

Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

Options:
  -h, --help            Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
  -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
  -V, --version         Display this application version
      --ansi|--no-ansi  Force (or disable --no-ansi) ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Available commands:
  completion  Dump the shell completion script
  help        Display help for a command
  list        List commands
  new         Create a new Laravel application
```

Nice! Now let's generate our project. First, let's create a project directory if you don't have one:

```bash title="~"
mkdir projects

cd projects
```

(Optional) Then create a `laravel` directory just to be organized.

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/projects"
mkdir laravel

cd laravel
```

Use the Laravel Installer to generate a project

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/projects/laravel"
laravel new
```

It will ask you some questions regarding on how you will start your project. Here's mine:

-   What is the name of your project? **my-project** (Name it whatever you want)
-   Would you like to install a starter kit? **Laravel Breeze**
-   Which Breeze stack would you like to install? **Vue with Inertia**
-   Would you like any optional features? **Dark mode, TypeScript**
-   Which testing framework do you prefer? **Pest**
-   Would you like to initialize a Git repository? **Yes**
-   Which database will your application use? **MySQL**
-   Default database updated. Would you like to run the default database migrations? **No**
    -   We don't need to run the default migrations immediately since we'll setup our MySQL container after the installation.

Alright! Now our project is generated, let's create our `compose.yaml` file!

First, let's open our project in VSCode.

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/projects/laravel"
cd my-project

code .
```

Then create a file in the root directory named `compose.yaml`

Let's start by defining our top-level `name`:

<Code
    lang="yaml"
    code={getSpecificLines(composeApacheYaml, 1, 1)}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/compose.yaml"
    showLineNumbers
/>

### Web Server

There are two main options for the web server of our Laravel app, which are `Apache` and `NGINX`. It of course, depends on your preference and the server you'll deploy your app.

#### Apache

Our PHP-Apache `app` service looks like this:

<Code
    lang="yaml"
    code={getSpecificLines(composeApacheYaml, 3, 29)}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/compose.yaml"
    showLineNumbers
    startLineNumber={3}
/>

It's a pretty basic single service that contains PHP and Apache together. You can also read the comments to know what it does, and you remove the comments after if you want.

The `Dockerfile` for this service is this:

<Code
    lang="dockerfile"
    code={dockerfileApache}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/Dockerfile"
    showLineNumbers
/>

Looks complicated, but it basically does these things:

1. Get the PHP 8.3 with Apache image from Docker Hub
1. Install system dependencies
1. Configure Apache to serve our app
1. Install PHP Extensions needed by Laravel
1. Get the latest Composer binary
1. Install Node.js
1. Set some permissions

#### NGINX

Now for NGINX, it's quite more complicated. This time we need to have 2 separate services: `app` and `server`. The `app` service will be our PHP service and `server` will be NGINX. The services looks like these:

<Code
    lang="yaml"
    code={getSpecificLines(composeNginxYaml, 3, 41)}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/compose.yaml"
    showLineNumbers
    startLineNumber={3}
/>

This is the `Dockerfile` for our `app` service:

<Code
    lang="dockerfile"
    code={dockerfileNginx}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/Dockerfile"
    showLineNumbers
/>

The `Dockerfile` for our `app` service is actually quite similar to the `Dockerfile` for our Apache service, except that we don't configure our web server inside this `Dockerfile`, since our NGINX service is separated. This `Dockerfile` does the following:

1. Get the PHP 8.3-fpm image from Docker Hub
1. Install system dependencies
1. Install PHP Extensions needed by Laravel
1. Get the latest Composer binary
1. Install Node.js
1. Set some permissions

Now, create a `.docker` directory to store our service configurations.

For our NGINX configuration, create a `app.conf` file on your `.docker/nginx/conf.d` directory:

<Code
    lang="nginx"
    code={nginxConf}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/.docker/nginx/conf.d/app.conf"
    showLineNumbers
/>

This is a pretty basic NGINX configuration. You can modify it as you want.

### Database

The database service for both web servers are the same. We'll just use `MySQL`:

<Code
    lang="yaml"
    code={getSpecificLines(composeApacheYaml, 31, 53)}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/compose.yaml"
/>

Alright! That's our services. Last thing, we need to define the volumes and networks we used:

<Code
    lang="yaml"
    code={getSpecificLines(composeApacheYaml, 55, 64)}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/compose.yaml"
/>

That's it! Here are the complete `compose.yaml` for both web servers:

#### Apache

<Code
    lang="yaml"
    code={composeApacheYaml}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/compose.yaml"
    showLineNumbers
/>

#### NGINX

<Code
    lang="yaml"
    code={composeNginxYaml}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/compose.yaml"
    showLineNumbers
/>

Now, before spinning up our services, we must update our `vite.config.ts` to enable HMR:

<Code
    lang="ts"
    code={viteConfig}
    title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/vite.config.ts"
    showLineNumbers
    useDiffSyntax={true}
/>

We also need to modify our `.env` for our app URL and database credentials:

```bash
APP_URL=http://my-project.localhost
...
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=my-project-mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=my_database
DB_USERNAME=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

Nice! It's finally time to spin up our services!

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/projects/laravel/my-project"
docker compose up -d
```

After the containers are built, you should be able to visit your Laravel app using the custom domain you assigned (http://my-project.localhost) in my case.

<img class="rounded-xl" src="/blog/02/laravel.png" />

You can check if the HMR works when you run the Vite dev server:

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/projects/laravel/my-project"
# Make sure NPM dependencies are installed
docker compose exec app npm install

docker compose exec app npm run dev
```

You can also run `artisan` and `composer` commands using the following:

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/projects/laravel/my-project"
docker compose exec app php artisan [COMMAND]

docker compose exec app composer [COMMAND]
```

## Bonus

Well, it's not fun to manually type all those commands every time I want to execute some `artisan`, `composer`, or `npm` commands. So I have a simple solution: `justfile`!

It's a command runner that we can use to alias our common commands throughout the project. To know more, you can read visit the repository <a href="https://github.com/casey/just" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Installation and Setup

1. Set up the APT repository

```bash title="~"
wget -qO - 'https://proget.makedeb.org/debian-feeds/prebuilt-mpr.pub' | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/prebuilt-mpr-archive-keyring.gpg 1> /dev/null
echo "deb [arch=all,$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/prebuilt-mpr-archive-keyring.gpg] https://proget.makedeb.org prebuilt-mpr $(lsb_release -cs)" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/prebuilt-mpr.list
sudo apt update
```

2. Install using APT

```bash
sudo apt install -y just
```

3. Create a `justfile` on the root of your project.

```make title="~/projects/laravel/my-project/justfile"
up:
    docker compose up -d
down:
    docker compose down
rebuild:
    docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
sh:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app bash
php *COMMAND:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app php {{COMMAND}}
artisan *COMMAND:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app php artisan {{COMMAND}}
composer *COMMAND:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app composer {{COMMAND}}
mysql *COMMAND:
    docker compose exec mysql mysql -uroot -proot {{COMMAND}}
node *COMMAND:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app node {{COMMAND}}
npm *COMMAND:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app npm {{COMMAND}}
dev:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app npm run dev
build:
    docker compose exec -u 1000 app npm run build
```

That's it! You can now just run your commands normally, just prefix it by `just`.

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/projects/laravel/my-project"
just artisan migrate:fresh --seed

just composer require spatie/laravel-permission

just npm run dev
# or
just dev
```

All those commands are just my personal preference to use. It's up to you what commands you want to alias. Feel free to modify the `justfile`!

## Conclusion

This is how you dockerize a modern Laravel Application effectively. While these configuration seems like a lot of work, it can save us a lot of time especially in production environments.
